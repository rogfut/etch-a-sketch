# The Odin Project
## Web Dev 101 - Etch-a-Sketch
This was created as an excercise from the Odin Project Web Dev 101 cirriculum

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

This code meets all the requirements - including the optional ones - for the odin project assignment.

## Instructions
* git clone the project
* launch index.html with your favorite browser - I recommend Chrome since I developed against it when I created this project

## Extra info

The purpose of this project is to show jquery + DOM manipulation skills.

I made this back in 2018.  As such, there are probably some bugfixes/improvements I would make if I had to do this project over today now that I have additional experience under my belt.
